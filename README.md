Prediction and Comparative Analysis of Economic Growth of Asian Countries Using Hybrid ARIMA Model

     Understanding the current and future state of the economy enables timely responses and policy measures to maintain economic and financial stability. The key focus in this work is to predict the growth of a particular countryâ€™s economic outlook using machine learning algorithms as well as data-mining techniques.In this project, the ARIMA model has been used. Since ARIMA requires continuous and periodic data, it is suitable for small-scale periodic data. It gave good performance for average monthly data but not for daily data. Instead, the neural network methods (including BP network and RNN) can predict well daily, weekly, and monthly trend of price fluctuation. It is more suitable for large-scale data.
